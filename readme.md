# Web Scraping - 1st Project at NYC Data Science Academy

## Market Research Analysis for Restaurant Expansion


The goal behind my project was to determine the optimal location for opening a new Eataly location in one of the major US metropolitan cities, all of which have a high population and avereage median income as cities with existing Eataly stores/restaurants. 

Using Scrapy to scrape 1000 restaurant ratings from the six potential cities - Seattle, Washington DC, Austin, San Francisco, Miami, and San Jose - I was able to deteremine which location would present the best opportunity for a new Eataly eatery primarily based on customer appreciation and restaurant availability in each city.
